# Release Notes for STM32N6_GettingStarted_Audio Application

## Purpose

This project provides an STM32 Microcontroler embedded real time environement
to execute [X-CUBE-AI](https://www.st.com/en/embedded-software/x-cube-ai.html)
generated model targetting audio applications. The purpose of this package is
to stream physical data acquired by sensors into a processing chain including a
preprocessing step that typically would perform a first level of feature
extraction, the machine learning inference itself, and a post processing step
before exposing the results to the user in real time.

## Key Features

- Deployement through ST Model Zoo
- Support of Audio Event Detection (AED) using Yamnet 1024
- Low power support:
  - Dynamic Voltage & Frequency Scaling (DFVS)
  - Dynamic Power Scaling (DPS)
- Bare Metal (BM) Implementation
- Real Time Operating System (RTOS) Implementation
- Random load generator
- Audio bypass
- Audio loop back
